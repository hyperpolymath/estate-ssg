**The definitive Forth static site generator.**

== Overview

estate-ssg is a stack-based static site generator written in Forth.
It demonstrates that even minimal, low-level languages can be effective
for building modern web tools.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in Forth. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* C (even for performance)
* Any language other than Forth

The **ONLY** non-Forth code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== Features

* Minimal dependencies - just needs Gforth
* Stack-based operations for content transformation
* Interactive REPL for site development
* Direct hardware access capabilities
* Extremely fast execution

== Requirements

* Gforth 0.7+
